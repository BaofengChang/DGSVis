### Abstract 
Dynamic graph visualization attracts researchersâ€™ concentration as it represents time-varying relationships between entities
in multiple domains (e.g., social media analysis, academic cooperation analysis, team sports analysis). Integrating visual analytic
methods is consequential in presenting, comparing, and reviewing dynamic graphs. Even though dynamic graph visualization is
developed for many years, how to effectively visualize large-scale, subtle-change, and intensive-time dynamic graph data is still
challenging for researchers. To provide an effective analysis method into this type of dynamic graph data, we propose a snapshot
extraction algorithm involving Human-In-Loop to help users divide the dynamic graphs into multi-granularity and hierarchical snapshots
for further analyzing. In addition, we design a visual analysis prototype system (DGSVis) to assist users in accessing the dynamic
graph insights effectively. DGSVis integrates a graphical operation interface to help users extract snapshots visually and interactively.
It is equipped with the overview and details for visualizing hierarchical snapshots of dynamic graph. To illustrate the usability and
efficiency of our proposed methods for this type of dynamic graph data, we introduce two case studies based on basketball player
networks in a competition. In addition, we conduct an evaluation and receive exciting feedback from experienced visualization experts
